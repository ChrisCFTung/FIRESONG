# Background

The IceCube neutrino observatory has discoved an all-sky neutrino flux
in the 10 TeV to 10 PeV energy range [@somebody]. This flux is apparently isotropic,
consistent with an extragalactic origin for these neutrinos. The flux
is also consistent with equal flux for each of the three neutrino
flavors [@somebody], as consistent with expectations for standard
neutrino oscillations over astrophysical baselines. The origin of this
flux is of great scientific interest as it is expected that neutrino
sources are also sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, which also
have an unknown origin [@somebody]. IceCube finds that a power law in
energy is a good description of the flux, with an spectral index
ranging from -2.28 to -2.89, depending on the observation channel used
[@somebody].

IceCube has identified the blazar, a sub-type of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN), TXS 0506+056 as a candidate neutrino source
[@somebody]. However, there's also evidence, also by IceCube that gamma-ray bright
blazars contribute to no more than 20% of the diffuse flux
[@somebody]. More recently IceCube has found a neutrino point source hot-spot, just below
the 3 sigma threshold normally assigned to evidence, correlated with
the Seyfert II galaxy, another subtype of AGN, NGC
1068 [@somebody]. Over the past 30 years, AGNs and Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs) were among the most prominent proposed extragalactic neutrino
sources. IceCube has ruled out GRBs as constributing more than 1% of
the diffuse flux [@somebody].

The identification of the main sources of the diffuse flux remains an
open topic. 


# Summary

Summary FIRESONG

Code is tailored for muon neutrinos, but can trivially be adapted by
a user to include all flavors.
